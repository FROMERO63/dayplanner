# dayplanner

## Description

This motivation for this project was to create day planner where you can store your tasks for the day
I wanted to allow the user to have a place where they can store tasks
I also added a feature that color coded the hour slots based on the current time. They would be different colors dependant on whether it was past, present, or future
This solved the problem of needing to keep track of tasks for the day
Some things that I learned in this challenge were how to use dayjs, to use if statements to compare time and theme switch. I also learned to update and edit html that was provided to be used how i needed it
I had difficulty working with local storage at first
For future development, i would like to learn how to clear local storage each day so the planner will be clean
